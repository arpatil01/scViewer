    o Bug fix.
    
BUG FIXES

    o harmoniseLevels
    Crashed sometimes, in older versions of R,
    with an obscure error message from 'mapply'.
    Fixed.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.geom VERSION 3.0-5

OVERVIEW

    o Convert several factors or factor-valued images to a common set of levels.
    
    o Extension to rjitter

    o Alternative to rjitter

    o Quantile function as a function

    o Improvements to plot code.

NEW FUNCTIONS

    o harmoniseLevels
    Given several factors or factor-valued pixel images,
    convert them all to have the same set of factor levels.

    o rexplode
    'Explode' a point pattern by randomly displacing each
    group of duplicated points to make a circular pattern
    around the original location. An alternative to 'rjitter'.

    o quantilefun
    Return a function that computes any quantiles of a given dataset.
    
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o rjitter.ppp
    If 'trim=TRUE', the displacement radius will be constrained
    to be less than or equal to the distance from the data point
    to the window boundary. 
    
    o plot.ppp
    For multitype point patterns, a warning is issued if 
    the plot legend does not represent every possible type of point
    due to space restrictions.

    o plot.symbolmap
    New argument 'warn'.

    o plot.symbolmap
    Issues a warning if the plot of a discrete symbol map does not
    represent every possible input value, due to space restrictions.

    o plot.solist
    When equal.ribbon=TRUE, the images may now be factor-valued
    or character-valued. Character-valued images will be converted
    to factor-valued images. The common colour map will combine the
    levels of all the factor images. 
    
BUG FIXES

    o "[<-.im"
    Errors occurred in x[] <- v when x and v were both factor-valued
    but with different sets of levels.

    o rjitter.ppp
    If retry=FALSE, marks were ignored.
    Fixed.

    o unnormdensity
    Argument 'weights' may have length 1.
    New argument 'defaults'.

    o distmap.owin

    This affects a few pixels close to the edge of the frame.
    [Suggested by Fernando Milesi.]

    o distmap.ppp
    New argument 'clip'.
    
BUG FIXES

    o distmap.owin
    If the window was a binary mask, the distance values were
    slightly too large (by a factor 1 + 1/n where n is the pixel grid dimension),
    due to a coding error.
    [Spotted by Fernando Milesi.]
    Fixed.
    
    o distfun.owin
    If the window was a binary mask, the distance values were
    slightly too small (typically reduced by 1/20 of a pixel width).
    [Spotted by Fernando Milesi.]
    Fixed.

    o distmap.owin
    Values were incorrect if X was an empty window (is.empty(X) = TRUE).
    Fixed.

    Fixed.
    
    o distmap.psp
    Values were incorrect if X was an empty pattern (nsegments(X) = 0).
    Fixed.
    
    o closepairs.ppp
    If distinct=FALSE and what="all", the resulting vectors
    'yi' and 'yj' contained incorrect values, and had the wrong length.
    Fixed.

    When k > 1, distance values were incorrectly replaced by 'Inf' in some cases.
    Fixed.
    
    o closepairs.ppp

    if the window of X had zero area.
    Fixed.

    o crosspairs.ppp
    Crashed with a message 'unable to allocate memory'
    if the window of Y had zero area.
    Fixed.

    o closepairs.pp3
    Crashed with a message 'unable to allocate memory'
    if the domain of X had zero volume.
    Fixed.

    o crosspairs.pp3
    Crashed with a message 'unable to allocate memory'
    if the domain of Y had zero volume.
    Fixed.

    o as.im.owin
    If 'value' was a categorical (factor) value, the result was not a factor-valued image.
    Fixed.

    o tile.areas
    For a tessellation defined by a pixel image,
    the result of tile.areas() was not a numeric vector.
    [Spotted by Suman Rakshit.]
    Fixed.

    o dirichlet
    Rarely, the number of tiles in the tessellation
    was less than the number of unique data points.
    This occurred only when the window was a binary mask.
    [Spotted by Suman Rakshit.]
    Fixed.

    o Increased speed for large datasets.

    o Bug fix in crossdist.pp3 with periodic distances.
    
    o Bug fixes and minor improvements.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o spatstat.geom
    The package 'spatstat.geom' has been created from a subset
    of the code in the original 'spatstat' package version 1.65-0.
    It contains definitions of geometrical objects (windows, point patterns,
    pixel images, etc) and operations on them (geometry, superposition,
    image arithmetic, etc).

    o Execution
    The 'spatstat.geom' package is slightly faster than the corresponding
    code in the 'spatstat' package, because the procedure for calling
    internal C functions has been streamlined.

    o dirichletEdges
    New argument 'clip'.

    o harmonise.im
    The result belongs to class 'solist' and 'imlist'
    so that it can be plotted.

BUG FIXES

    o crossdist.pp3
    Results with periodic=TRUE were partially incorrect.
    Fixed.
    
    o affine.owin
    For mask windows, the pixel resolution of the result
    was too fine, leading to very large datasets.
    Fixed.

    o affine.im
    If the transformation matrix was not diagonal, the pixel resolution
    of the result was too fine, leading to very large datasets.
    Fixed.

    o plot.ppp
    For a point pattern in a binary mask window,
    if both arguments 'col' and 'cols' were given,
    the points were coloured according to 'col', which was incorrect.
    Fixed.
    
    o dirichletEdges
    Crashed if any edges crossed the boundary of the window.
    Fixed.

    o unitname
    Spatial datasets with incorrect internal format
    (or using an out-of-date version of the spatstat format)
    caused an error if the 'units' package was loaded.
    Fixed.
