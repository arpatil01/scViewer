SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Package structure
    The package 'spatstat.core' has been split into two packages called
    'spatstat.explore' (for exploratory data analysis)
    and 'spatstat.model' (for modelling and formal inference).

    o spatstat.explore
    The new package 'spatstat.explore' contains the code for
    exploratory data analysis and nonparametric analysis
    of spatial data. Examples include 'density.ppp', 'Kest',
    'envelope', 'rhohat', 'clarkevans.test'.

    o NEWS
    The NEWS file for the new package 'spatstat.explore'
    contains older news items from the defunct package 'spatstat.core'
    (for functions which are now in 'spatstat.explore').

    o Kest, Kdot, Kcross, Ldot, Lcross, Kmulti
    These functions now accept the option 'correction="periodic"'
    to compute the periodic (toroidal) edge correction estimate.

    o Kest, pcf, Ksector, Kdot, Kcross, Kmulti
    When ratio=TRUE, the denominator is now equal to the number of pairs of
    points considered. This does not affect the estimate of the summary
    function, but it changes the calculation of pooled estimates
    when the estimates were obtained from different sized windows.
    
    o markcorr, markcrosscorr
    These functions now allow negative mark values when normalise=FALSE.
    
    o marktable
    This function now works for point patterns in three dimensions (class 'pp3')
    and point patterns on a network (class 'lpp').
    
    o bw.relrisk
    This function is now generic, with a method for class 'ppp'

    o compileK, compilepcf
    These functions have a new argument 'samplesize'.
    If 'ratio=TRUE' the numerator and denominator will be rescaled
    by a common factor so that the denominator is equal to 'samplesize'.

    o adaptive.density
    Now accepts 'method="nearest"' and passes the data to 'nndensity'.

    o rhohat.ppp
    New options 'smoother="mountain"' and 'smoother="valley"'
    for estimating a unimodal function (U-shaped curve).

    o rhohat.ppp
    If the covariate is a 'distfun', the name of the unit of length is saved
    and displayed on the plot.

    o rhohat.ppp
    New arguments 'jitter', 'jitterfactor', 'interpolate' allow greater
    control over the calculation.

    o rhohat.ppp
    New argument 'do.CI' specifies whether to calculate confidence bands.
    
        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 2.4-4.010

OVERVIEW

    o Internal improvements.


        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 2.4-4

OVERVIEW

    o Bug fixes and minor improvements.

BUG FIXES

    o rhohat.ppp
    The argument 'subset' was not handled correctly in the internal data.
    The estimated function 'rho' was correct, but if 'predict.rhohat' was applied,
    predictions were computed only in the 'subset', and were possibly incorrect values.
    Fixed.

    o Gfox, Jfox
    Warnings were issued about text formatting errors (mentioning 'sprintf' or 'fmt').
    Fixed.
    
        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 2.4-3

    Crashed when 'kernel' was a function, 'at="points"' and 'scalekernel=FALSE'.
    Fixed.

    o Finhom, Ginhom, Jinhom
    Crashed when ratio=TRUE.
    [Spotted by Art Stock.]
    Fixed.
    
    o envelope
    Crashed for some of the summary functions when ratio=TRUE.
    [Spotted by Art Stock.]
    Fixed.

    o "[.rat"
    Crashed in some cases.
    Fixed.

    o Kcross
    The result of Kcross() was 'invisible',
    i.e. it was not automatically printed.
    Fixed.

    reducing the likelihood of strange-looking plots when 'sigma' is very small.

BUG FIXES

    o density.ppp
    Crashed if the observation window had zero area.
    Fixed.

    o dirichletVoronoi.ppp

    Rarely, produced an image containing NA values.
    [Spotted by Suman Rakshit.]
    Fixed.

    o collapse.fv
    Columns identified by the arguments 'same' and 'different'
    may now be absent from some of the 'fv' objects that will be collapsed.

    Now prints a message indicating whether the data were recomputed

    around a constant function.
    Fixed.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-0

OVERVIEW

    o Package initialised at version 1.65-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o spatstat.core
    The package 'spatstat.core' has been created from a subset
    of the code in the original 'spatstat' package version 1.65-0.
    It contains the core functionality for statistical analysis of
    spatial data. For an overview, see help("spatstat.core-package")

    o Execution
    The 'spatstat.core' package is slightly faster than the corresponding
    code in the 'spatstat' package, because the procedure for calling
    internal C functions has been streamlined.
