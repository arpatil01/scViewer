Description: A fast negative binomial mixed model for conducting association analysis of multi-subject single-cell data. It can be used for identifying marker genes, differential expression and co-expression analyses. The model includes subject-level random effects to account for the hierarchical structure in multi-subject single-cell data. See He et al. (2021) <doi:10.1038/s42003-021-02146-6>.
