Title: 'Rcpp' Bindings to Parser for "Tom's Obvious Markup Language"
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 2023-01-29
Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel
Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: The configuration format defined by 'TOML' (which expands to
 "Tom's Obvious Markup Language") specifies an excellent format
 (described at <https://toml.io/en/>) suitable for both human editing
 as well as the common uses of a machine-readable format. This package
 uses 'Rcpp' to connect to the 'toml++' parser written by Mark Gillard
 to R.
